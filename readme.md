# eYRC 2023-24 Theme: GeoGuide - Unveiling Vanguard

**Introduction:**
eYRC 2023-24 presents "Vanguard," an advanced robotic vehicle, as part of the GeoGuide theme. Guided by the static drone Watchtower and equipped with machine learning algorithms, Vanguard navigates a war-torn arena. Watchtower detects events in real-time, enabling Vanguard to avoid danger zones and adapt to unpredictable alien attacks. With georeferencing techniques, Vanguard understands its position and coordinates with the command centre to strategize against invaders.

**Core Focus:**
The core focus of this theme is to create an autonomous robot capable of navigating an arena using an overhead camera for guidance. The arena will mimic a real-world setting, complete with simulated events and accidents that the robot must successfully avoid. By participating in this theme, students will construct their robot, named "Vanguard," utilizing the ESP32 microcontroller. They will delve into fascinating realms of image processing and machine learning, acquiring valuable skills and knowledge along the way.
